## Personal Portfolio Project

An evergreen WIP Portfolio site for my work as a Photographer/Videographer, to be utilized
as an online destination for my work and as a canvas to implement new skills and designs.
As of now, built _straight vanilla_ in order to challenge myself and polish on the 
fundamentals. As I grow as a developer, it shall.


#### Arrival

Features carousel like rotation of photos I feel are particularly eye catching and represent
my journey as a (photo/video)grapher. Transitions to selectio of sections currently 
available on the site.


#### Self Concept

Features interactive sections that reveal excerpts describing the journey and experiences
that I've been on (in regards to both web development and photography/videography) which
led to the development of this project / site


#### Gallery

Hosts (most) of my creative work as a photographer (video work coming in future updates)
divided into the sections which I believe describe the content well. Custom made 'Photo 
Room' viewer - as with everything else. 

<sub>It is also my intention to build a custom video viewer as well</sub>


#### Transmissions

**WIP**

To be an interactive form in which site visitors can email me directly.
